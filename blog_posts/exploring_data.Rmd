# Graphically Exploring Data

Your second step after data import should always be to *look at the data*. That means plotting lots of things, and getting a sense of how everything fits together.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
fig <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = contrast, y = y)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(sf_factor ~ subject) + 
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0.45, 1.05)) +
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0.5, 0.75, 1))
fig
```
