"A Well Thought-Out Englilsh Paper"
by Kyle "The Yellow Dart" Smith
Since maybe like the Middle Ages, there have been many
differing opinions on hustle and bustle. This cannot be
denied. It is my intention to sit down and play video games
for several hours.

First, moving around quickly, and with purpose, is a
true sign of character. Secondarily, bustle(e.g. hustle)
yields more product for the working types. "Hustle and bustle
are like my right and left arms," said Li'l Spicy in his famous
"Hustle and Bustle Are Like My Right and Left Arms" speech.
Webster's defines bustle as "excited and often noisy activity;
a stir." A stir, indeed. Finally, sometimes gross stuff can
be funny.

In conclusion, I, "The Yellow Dart," think I have done a
great job illustrating the many differing opinions about hustle
and bustle, may they both rest in peace. Also, I think Strong
Bad should decrease The Cheat's allowance.
